<h1>-Granger Causality Test on Stop-and-Search Arrests and Crime Categories</h1>

<h1>-Analysis Description
<h2></h2>
This notebook conducts a Granger causality test to examine whether stop-and-search activities, specifically arrests resulting from these operations, have an impact on various categories of crimes. By applying statistical methods and time series analysis, the study seeks to determine if the patterns in stop-and-search arrests can predict changes in different crime categories. The findings aim to provide insights into the effectiveness of stop-and-search practices in influencing crime rates, which can inform law enforcement strategies and policy-making.
